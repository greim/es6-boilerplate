# React, iojs, koa, gulp, browserify, ES6, babel, boilerplate SPA.

This is a boilerplate project showcasing a fully-functional hello-world SPA built using the following technologies:

 * Target server platform: io.js
 * Language: es6
 * Transpilation: babel
 * Server-side framework: koa
 * Client-side framework: react
 * Build tooling: gulp
 * CSS dialect: less

## What is this supposed to be?

I use this as a reference point and a proving ground for new tech. I might clone it when I start new projects for example. I thought maybe other people would find it instructive/useful also. If you see room for improvement, file an issue!

## Design goals

 * **ES6** - ES6 everywhere.
 * **Sane imports** - `lib/thing`, not `./lib/thing` or `../../../thing`.
 * **Generators** - Eliminate callbacks by using generators for async flow control.
 * **Bleeding-edge** - Not all will agree, but I think messing with new toys is fun.
 * **Learning and sharing** - Thought others might get a kick out of this.

## Not design goals

 * Showcasing an enterprize-ready solution.
 * Yeoman- or rails-like configurable scaffolding for new projects.
 * Covering every possible nice-to-have use case.
