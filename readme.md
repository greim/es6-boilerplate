# React, iojs, koa, gulp, browserify, ES6, babel, boilerplate SPA.

This is a boilerplate project showcasing a fully-functional—but MINIMAL—hello-world single-page-app built using high technology.

 * Target server platform: **io.js** - https://iojs.org/en/index.html
 * Language: **es6** - http://www.2ality.com/2014/08/es6-today.html
 * Transpilation: **babel** - https://babeljs.io/
 * Bundling and import strategy: **browserify** - http://browserify.org/
 * Server-side framework: **koa** - http://koajs.com/
 * Client-side framework: **react** - http://facebook.github.io/react/
 * Build tooling: **gulp** - http://gulpjs.com/
 * CSS dialect: **less** - http://lesscss.org/

## What is this supposed to be?

I'm using this as a reference point and a proving ground for new tech. I might clone it when I start new projects for example. I thought maybe other people would find it instructive/useful also. If you see room for improvement, file an issue!

## Design goals

 * **ES6** - ES6 everywhere.
 * **Minimal** - No deep functionality, just how to fit pieces together.
 * **Sane imports** - `import thing from 'lib/thing'`, never `'../../../thing'`.
 * **Eliminate callbacks** - Use generators, or even better async/await, for async flow control.
 * **Bleeding-edge** - Not all will agree, but I think messing with new toys is fun.
 * **Learning and sharing** - Thought others might get a kick out of this.
 * **Get made fun of** - Maybe I'm doing something obviously wrong. I want to know about it.

## Not design goals

 * Showcasing an enterprize-ready solution.
 * Yeoman- or rails-like configurable scaffolding for new projects.
 * Covering every possible nice-to-have use case.
